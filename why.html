    <h1>Why does this exist?</h1>
    <p>Because being smart does not scale.</p>
    <p>Not everyone is smart and nobody can be smart all of the time.</p>
    <p>
      Most frameworks focus on reducing boilerplate, but a consequence of
      reduced boilerplate is needing to keep implicit context in your head.
      Understand more bespoke mechanics. To be smarter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The value proposition of something like a <code>Rails</code> is that you
      get something that "just works," but the <i>real</i> value proposition to
      a buisiness is that you can go to the coder store and order 5
      <code>Rails</code> developers off the shelf.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a bootcamp, university, or someone out for a quick buck things
      like <code>Rails</code>, <code>Django</code>, <code>Spring</code>, etc.
      are a godsend. You can have people in for 10 weeks, get them making a
      website, get them hired, and move on to the next batch.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>But.</b>
      While the ability to write <code>super-awesome-framework init</code> and
      get a website that talks to a database quickly <i>is</i> cool, it has a
      negative effect on each developer's understanding of the codebase.
    </p>

    <p>Human beings do very, very, very poorly with "implicit" information.</p>

    <p>
      If you start up a <code>Spring</code> app and authorization is controlled
      by a random line in a config file that is super convenient, but ultimately
      harmful if you need any aspects of how that authorization works to be
      changed by a flesh and blood human being.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I wanted to try and make a framework that optimizes for different
      things.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Instead of being super quick to set up, you need to follow an N-part
        tutorial.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instead of being super easy to use, you need to write code out
        explicitly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instead of being developed by a single organization, features are
        brought in by single-purpose independently developed libraries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instead of things being easy, things are
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4">simple</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    I believe that all of these properties lead to software that is easier to
    maintain and alter over time. If you are a fan of

    I hope you see what I am getting at here. If not, that's fine too.
