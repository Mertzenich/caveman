<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>A web framework.</p>

<p>
    It is a series of steps you can follow to build up to a real,
    production-ready application. I also think the way you will build out
    things implies a set of principles you can follow to make your life
    simpler.
</p>

<p>I think It's reasonable to ask "in what way is that a framework?"</p>

<p>I view frameworks as being
    fundamentally about getting large
    groups of people to use similar technologies and approach problems in similar ways. Giving a branded
    set of cohesive libraries maintained by some central group is just one approach.</p>

<p>This will be a different one.</p>
