    <h1>Who is this for?</h1>
    <p>You.</p>

    <p>But more seriously - for intermediate developers.</p>

    <p>
      The sort of folk that knows how to program, maybe has even made a website
      or two, but still has to follow tutorials and doesn't have a rock solid
      understanding of what goes into making a website.

    <p>
      A fuzzy group, I know, but there are a lot of things I am not going to
      explain. Such as how to write code in a particular language or how to open
      a terminal. I am open to adding more context for sure, but the structure I
      have in mind for this would serve as a poor CS 101 curriculum.
    </p>

    <p>Keep that in mind as you go.</p>
