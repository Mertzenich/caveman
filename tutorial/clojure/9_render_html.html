<h1>Render HTML. </h1>
<p>For websites, which is not what all HTTP servers are, your primary task is often to produce HTML
    responses.</p>
<p>The point of logging is to have some visibility into your running program. For things deployed on a thousand machines
    this is a harder problem than a handful of servers. All we need is a structured way of outputting text.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Add <code>hiccup</code> to your deps.edn</h2>
        <p>This is a library which takes data structures and produces HTML.</p>
        <p>The upside to using something like this to produce HTML is that you can have
        your HTML embedded directly into the code without a separate templating language.</p>
        <p>The downside is that your HTML won't be already in HTML form, which precludes usage
        of some tooling and people.</p>

        <h2>Render HTML in your handlers</h2>
        <p>It's important to only use the <code>hiccup2.core</code> namespace. The <code>hiccup.core</code>
        one has some intrinsic problems you don't want to deal with.</p>
        <p>Similarly to <code>reitit</code> routes, the input here is a data structure. There are tools for converting HTML
        snippets you want to use automatically into this hiccup format. Some are documented <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/wiki/Converting-html-to-hiccup">HERE</a>.</p>
